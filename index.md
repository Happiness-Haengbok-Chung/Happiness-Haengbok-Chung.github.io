## About Me <img src="assets/img/car0.jpg" alt="Your image" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;" width="80" height="80">

I am an [MCS](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/professional-mcs/campus-master-computer-science) student at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu). I received an M.S. in [Artificial Intelligence from Seoul National University (SNU)](https://gsai.snu.ac.kr/), where I had the great privilege of being advised by Prof. [Jae Sung Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NXlghNYAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao). I was honored and fortunate to continue my research at SNU as a post-masterâ€™s intern under the guidance of Prof. [Bohyung Han](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=ko&user=9aaeCToAAAAJ). My time at SNU was a truly wonderful research experience, and I hold deep respect and gratitude for the professors who guided and inspired me throughout my journey. I hold a B.S. in [Computer Science from Ewha Womans University](https://cse.ewha.ac.kr/cse/index.do), where I was blessed to work on a Capstone Design Project advised by Prof. [Hieonn Kim](https://kr.linkedin.com/in/%ED%98%84%EC%88%98-%EA%B9%80-50424a18b) and Prof. [Dongbo Min](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=ko&user=3REUPXYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&citft=1&email_for_op=hb0522%40snu.ac.kr&gmla=ANZ5fUP63sEo98hY2CF0Pn0c1c1yJexX52ZO4Z1Cv1xrY5T2718Wo2It5ehKtC_dbGYP63mxbQrAXzQYNX_VzNrX13d0AlxojZmrbvoZhHGjTlfm4Gr5Zc7msf79C0eR1FQpDZOYzThQOvxnMcf4eGZzihKvhyoqjKjHwwwXyDjkpY-P0X4YL-TpDikp9F1OGlp6ubqYWVuSaflB0UIXVDhuAFrjgyLaedOFQWAZPc77-aiTdH968zOYjunXR3v3sm94eQ). I was also lucky enough to complete a research internship at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/kr/) under the supervision of Prof. [Jong Chul Ye](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=ko&user=HNMjoNEAAAAJ), for which I am truly grateful.
